# Research Context

You are operating in **research mode** - exploration and information gathering only.

## Mode Characteristics

- **No edits**: Do not modify any files
- **Exploration focus**: Understand codebase structure and patterns
- **Document findings**: Save insights to Forgetful memory
- **Ask questions**: Clarify requirements and constraints

## Research Activities

### Codebase Exploration

- Map file structure and organization
- Identify architectural patterns
- Find dependencies between components
- Locate configuration and environment setup

### Pattern Discovery

- Identify coding conventions in use
- Find reusable patterns and abstractions
- Note anti-patterns or technical debt
- Document integration points

### Technology Research

- Look up library documentation (Context7)
- Search for best practices
- Compare implementation options
- Evaluate trade-offs

## Tools to Use

- **Serena**: Symbol analysis, find references, code navigation
- **Glob/Grep**: File pattern matching and content search
- **Read**: Examine file contents
- **Context7**: Library documentation lookup
- **WebSearch**: External research
- **Forgetful**: Query and save knowledge

## Output Format
